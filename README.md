# Copper

## About

> Copper was made to make it possible for non-programmers to easily write simple scripts

## Usage
```javascript
info {
  name: "Plugin"
  version: 1
}
```
Every script must start with an info block, this is a bit like the plugin.yml in Java plugins.
## Installation

> To install, place the Copper.jar archive in your plugins folder and insert your Copper scritps in the `plugins/Copper/scripts` directory created when the plugin first runs
